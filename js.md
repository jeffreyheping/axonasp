# 🚀 AXONASP: JSCRIPT MODERNIZATION & ES6+ EXPANSION ROADMAP

This document serves as a high-precision checklist for implementing ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and modern ES11-ES24 features into the AxonASP JScript engine.

## 🎯 CORE DIRECTIVES

1. **Strict Isolation:** Modify ONLY JScript-related files (`axonvm/compiler_jscript.go`, `axonvm/vm_jscript.go`, etc.). DO NOT touch VBScript logic or general VM state that could affect VBScript behavior. If you need to modify the VM, ensure it is strictly for JScript and does not introduce regressions or change the VBScript behavior.
2. **Performance Axioms:**
* **Zero-Allocation:** Avoid creating new Go objects on the heap during hot paths.
* **No Reflection:** Use the established `Value` struct and switch-based dispatch.
* **Minimal GC Impact:** Prefer native Go primitives and stack-based operations. Avoid the use of interfaces or any constructs that could trigger GC cycles.
3. **VM Architecture Context (Crucial):**
    * The AxonASP Eval loop is procedural (a large for loop labeled aspExecLoop).
    *It uses a custom memory-managed stack (stack []Value), a callStack []CallFrame, and sp, fp, and ip pointers.
* **NO Go Host Recursion:** User scripts run 100% isolated within the loop. Function calls (OpCall) just push a frame and jump ip. OpRet pops the frame and restores ip/sp/fp. Native Go recursion is strictly for native built-ins. Leverage this architecture heavily, especially for stack management and state pausing.
3. **Validation:** Every step MUST be accompanied by a GoLang test case in `axonvm/jscript_es6_test.go` and a javascript ASP test page in `./www/tests/test_*.asp` that must run with success in `axonasp-cli.exe -r <filename>`. Don't delete the test files, just add new ones for the new features. Ensure that all existing tests pass without modification to confirm no regressions.
4. After implementing the features, update the documentation in `./www/manual/md/javascript/jscript-es6-support.md` to reflect the new capabilities and any limitations.
5. Please think and do your best job. I trust you.

**Objective:** Implement missing ECMAScript 2020+ features, ergonomic APIs, and advanced architectural updates into the AxonASP JScript engine.

# 🚀 AXONASP: JSCRIPT ES6+ GAP FILLING & MODERNIZATION ROADMAP

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for missing ES6+ features, starting from foundational legacy functions and progressing towards advanced metaprogramming APIs. 

## 🎯 CORE DIRECTIVES
1. **Strict Isolation:** Modify ONLY JScript-related files (`vm_jscript.go`, `compiler_jscript.go`, etc.).
2. **Performance Axioms:** Prioritize Zero-Allocation. Map string/math operations to native Go standard libraries wherever possible.
3. **Validation:** Every phase requires Go unit tests and `.asp` test pages to guarantee zero regressions.

## 🛠️ PHASE 3: OBJECT STATICS (MODERATE-HIGH COMPLEXITY)

**Goal:** Complete the `Object` constructor static methods.

### Tasks:

    * SUBPHASE 3.1: Object Static Methods
        * [ ] **Object.is:** Implement `Object.is(value1, value2)`. It must behave exactly like `===` except it correctly evaluates `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` as `true` and differentiates `+0` and `-0`.
        * [ ] **Object.setPrototypeOf:** Implement `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`. Hook into the internal VM state (e.g., `vm.jsSetProto`) to re-wire the object's `__proto__` reference dynamically. Throw `TypeError` if `obj` is not extensible or `prototype` is invalid.
        * [ ] **Object.getOwnPropertySymbols:** Implement `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)`. Scan the object's internal property map for keys that are specifically typed as Symbols (if your engine uses a special prefix or type flag for Symbols).
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_object_statics.asp`. Validate `NaN` equality, prototype chaining alterations, and symbol extraction.


---

## 🛠️ PHASE 4: INTERNATIONALIZATION API (HIGH COMPLEXITY)

**Goal:** Implement the `Intl` API. This is heavy; prioritize integration with Go's `golang.org/x/text` packages.

### Tasks:
The Intl API - We must use the same system we use with the VBScript for internationalization/localization. We have already implemented the necessary Go functions in VBScript to handle locale-aware formatting and parsing - check the locale_format.go file/mslcid.go/builtins_vbscript_compat.go. Now we need to expose these capabilities to the JScript environment through the `Intl` namespace.
    * SUBPHASE 5.1: The Intl Namespace
        * [ ] **Setup:** Register the `Intl` global object in `ensureJSRootEnv`. If a locale is not set, default to locale and language set in axonasp.toml or fallback to `"en-US"` like in VBScript implementation (locale_format.go).
    * SUBPHASE 5.2: Intl.DateTimeFormat
        * [ ] **Constructor:** Implement `Intl.DateTimeFormat([locales[, options]])`. Map JS locales to Go `language.Tag`.
        * [ ] **Format:** Implement the `format()` method, converting the JS Date object to Go's `time.Time` and formatting it according to the requested locale conventions using the AxonASP localization libraries.
    * SUBPHASE 5.3: Intl.NumberFormat
        * [ ] **Constructor:** Implement `Intl.NumberFormat([locales[, options]])`.
        * [ ] **Format:** Implement `format()`. Support `style: 'decimal'`, `style: 'currency'`, and `style: 'percent'`, applying correct locale-specific grouping separators and currency symbols using `locale_format.go`, `golang.org/x/text/message`, `github.com/goodsign/monday` and `golang.org/x/text/language` and `currency`.
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_intl.asp`. Format large numbers, currencies, and dates in `"en-US"`, `"pt-BR"`, and `"de-DE"`.
```

### Phase 5: Hard Constraints & Major Libraries (Extreme Complexity)

These are massive undertakings. Do not start these unless Phase 1-4 are 100% stable.

**Subphase 5.1: RegExp Engine Replacement**

* **Target:** Named Capture Groups, Lookbehind, Lookahead.
* **Implementation Tips:** Go's native `regexp` package guarantees linear time (O(n)) to prevent ReDoS attacks, which means it explicitly omits Lookaround and Backreferences. To support full JS RegExp, we would need to integrate a PCRE-compatible engine (like `regexp2`). Note: This breaks our strict "no external engines" rule, so advise the user before proceeding.
    * RegExp Sticky Flag & Properties
        * [ ] **RegExp.prototype.flags:** Implement the getter for `flags`. It must return a string of active flags (`g`, `i`, `m`, `u`, `y`) in alphabetical order.
        * [ ] **Sticky Flag (y) Logic:** Modify the `RegExp` execution logic inside `vm_jscript.go`. If the `y` flag is present, ensure the matching engine explicitly anchors the search to start *exactly* at the `lastIndex` property of the RegExp object. Update `lastIndex` upon match or reset it to `0` on failure.
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_regexp_sticky.asp`. Create a sticky regex and advance `lastIndex` manually to ensure matches only occur exactly at that index.


---

## 🛠️ PHASE 6: PROXIES & REFLECTION (HIGH COMPLEXITY)

**Goal:** Introduce metaprogramming capabilities.

### Tasks:
Follow the subphase breakdown below for a structured implementation of Proxies and the Reflect API:
    * SUBPHASE 7.1: Core Types & Global Built-ins Setup
        * [ ] **Internal Representation:** Define the internal memory model for Proxies without breaking the `Value` struct. Either introduce a `VTJSProxy` type or utilize `VTJSObject` with hidden internal properties (e.g., `[[ProxyTarget]]` and `[[ProxyHandler]]`).
        * [ ] **Global Registration:** Inject the `Proxy` constructor and the `Reflect` namespace object into the global JScript environment upon VM initialization.
        * [ ] **Constructor Logic:** Implement the `new Proxy(target, handler)` built-in function. Ensure it throws a `TypeError` if `target` or `handler` are not valid objects (`VTJSObject` or `VTJSFunction`).
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_proxy_init.asp` to verify `Proxy` and `Reflect` exist globally and that `new Proxy()` correctly validates its arguments.
    * SUBPHASE 7.2: Intercepting Property Access (`get` & `set` Traps)
        * [ ] **Get Trap:** Deeply hook into `vm.jsMemberGet`. If the object is a Proxy, inspect the `[[ProxyHandler]]` for a `"get"` property. If present, invoke it as a function with `(target, property, receiver)`. If not, forward the operation to the `[[ProxyTarget]]`.
        * [ ] **Set Trap:** Hook into `vm.jsMemberSet` and `vm.jsIndexSet`. Check the handler for a `"set"` property. Invoke it with `(target, property, value, receiver)`. 
        * [ ] **Strict Mode Enforcement:** In strict mode, if a `set` trap returns a falsy value, the VM MUST throw a `TypeError`.
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_proxy_get_set.asp` to ensure properties can be dynamically intercepted, modified, or blocked without leaking memory or escaping the VM stack.
    * SUBPHASE 7.3: Intercepting Execution (`apply` & `construct` Traps)
        * [ ] **Callable Proxies:** A Proxy is only callable if its `[[ProxyTarget]]` is a `VTJSFunction`. Enforce this during instantiation.
        * [ ] **Apply Trap:** Hook into the VM's `OpCall` handler. If the callee is a Proxy, check for an `"apply"` trap. If present, invoke it with `(target, thisArg, argumentsList)`.
        * [ ] **Construct Trap:** Hook into the VM's `OpNew` handler. Check for a `"construct"` trap. Invoke it with `(target, argumentsList, newTarget)`. Ensure the return value is an object, otherwise throw a `TypeError`.
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_proxy_apply_construct.asp` to test intercepting function calls and constructor invocations.
    * SUBPHASE 7.4: Intercepting Object Operations (`has`, `deleteProperty`, `ownKeys`)
        * [ ] **Has Trap:** Hook into the `in` operator logic (e.g., `OpJSIn`). Route to the `"has"` trap if defined.
        * [ ] **Delete Trap:** Hook into the `delete` operator logic. Route to the `"deleteProperty"` trap. Enforce strict mode throwing if the trap returns `false`.
        * [ ] **Keys/Enumeration:** Hook into `OpForIn` and `Object.keys()` internal logic to support the `"ownKeys"` trap, ensuring it returns a valid Array or iterable of strings/symbols.
        * [ ] **Object Traps:** Hook into `in` (`has`), `delete` (`deleteProperty`), and `Object.keys()` (`ownKeys`).
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_proxy_operations.asp` to verify operator interception works flawlessly.
    * SUBPHASE 7.5: The `Reflect` API Implementation
        * [ ] **Reflect Methods:** Implement `Reflect.get()`, `Reflect.set()`, `Reflect.apply()`, `Reflect.construct()`, `Reflect.has()`, `Reflect.deleteProperty()`, and `Reflect.ownKeys()`.
        * [ ] **Parity & Invocation:** Ensure these methods directly map to the internal VM dispatch mechanics (the exact same internal methods used when traps forward to the target).
        * [ ] **Return Semantics:** Unlike standard operators which might throw in strict mode, ensure `Reflect.set()` and `Reflect.deleteProperty()` return boolean success flags as dictated by the ES6 spec.
        * [ ] **Validation:** Create `test_reflect_api.asp` to verify parity between Proxy traps and Reflect invocations.
    * SUBPHASE 7.6: Final Agent Checklist
        * [ ] **Gofmt:** Run `gofmt` on all modified files.
        * [ ] **VBScript Check:** Run `go test ./axonvm -run TestVBScript` to ensure deep VM hooks into member resolution did NOT break VBScript `.` access.
        * [ ] **Memory Profile:** Run `go test -bench . -benchmem`. Proxy traps involve nested VM calls; ensure `CallFrame` allocations remain strictly stack-bound (Zero-Allocation axiom).
        * [ ] **Error Codes:** Ensure correct use of error codes from `jscripterrorcodes.go` for trap violations and TypeErrors.
        * [ ] **Documentation:** Update `jscript-es6-support.md` detailing the supported Proxy traps and the `Reflect` API features.
